**SerbisKo** is an AI-powered local service finder built for the Filipino community. Whether you need a plumber, tutor, or cleaner, SerbisKo connects everyday people with skilled local freelancers — fast, easy, and reliable.

> “Serbisyo ko. Para sa’yo.”

---

## Overview

In the Philippines, many skilled workers don’t know how to market themselves online unless they’re connected to a company or rely on word-of-mouth via Facebook. **SerbisKo** gives these freelancers a platform to offer their services, gain reviews, and get discovered — even if they don’t know how to write a long promotional post.

This platform is built **by a Filipino, for Filipinos**, and aims to become the go-to service hub for local communities.

---

## AI-Assisted Matching (Coming Soon)

SerbisKo will feature an AI-powered assistant that understands natural Filipino/Taglish input and connects them to the right local service provider.

For example:

> **User:** “Yung AC ko maingay at hindi na lumalamig.”  
> **AI:** “Mukhang kailangan mo ng aircon technician. Gusto mo bang mag-book ngayon?”

⚠️ The specific AI model is still **being explored**, with options open for open-source LLMs or cloud APIs.

### Backend 

**Core Technologies:**
- **FastAPI** (v0.116.1) - Async API framework
- **SQLAlchemy** (v2.0.41) - ORM for PostgreSQL
- **Pydantic** (v2.11.7) - Data validation
- **JWT Authentication** via python-jose
- **Alembic** (v1.16.4) - Database migrations
- **Bcrypt** (v4.3.0) - Password hashing

> **Why FastAPI over Django?**  
> FastAPI is simpler to scaffold, async-first, and better suited for lightweight, modular microservices — perfect for building scalable and AI-ready APIs.
